# Electric-Skateboard-Project

This repository records the design process of our custom electric dinghy board. Our goal for this project is to practice designing and building complex systems that serve as experience to better solve engineering problems in the future.

# R&D
In preparation for creating this board, we needed to investigate the different components of existing skateboards to plan our own board’s frame and electric component construction. Additionally, we brushed up on relevant design, manufacturing, and electronics knowledge in preparation for the build. 

A skateboard frame has 3 main components: the board, trucks, and wheels. We have decided to manufacture the board and trucks, but purchase aftermarket skateboard wheels and bearings. We chose this approach to eliminate manufacturing tasks that would not be feasible/cost-effective within our time frame. Additionally, designing custom trucks gives us more freedom with mounting points for the motor and battery pack if needed. Finally, we wanted to build the board from scratch because it would allow us to personalize its shape, size, and visual elements.

After researching the electronics needed for the project, we created a parts list to plan how everything would work together. For the skateboard’s power system, we purchased 36 18650 cells to weld together a custom 9S 4P battery pack capable of powering a 2.5kW brushless motor and speed controller. To finish off the power system, we will purchase a compatible BMS to monitor cell voltages when charging and discharging. 

Powering the skateboard’s wheels will involve purchasing a pulley and wheel sprocket system from Amazon as we cannot manufacture it ourselves to the desired precision for this application. To easily control the skateboard, we will create a remote that will wirelessly connect and send commands to a main microcontroller board on the underside of the frame.

Designing the different components will be done using SOLIDWORKS, so to practice for the final prototype we have taken measurements from existing trucks and board frames and created CAD models and technical drawings of them. We have access to a milling machine that will be given these models later on to cut the parts we need for the board.
